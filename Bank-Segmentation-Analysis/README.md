# Bank Segmentation Analysis â€“ Case Summary

> **Project Type**: SQL-Only Financial Data Analysis  
> **Tool Used**: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)  
> **Dataset**: Simulated Nigerian bank data (Customers, Accounts, Transactions)  
> **Date Completed**: May 25, 2025

## Project Overview

The **Bank Segmentation Analysis** project was designed to simulate the kind of strategic data work encountered in real banking or fintech environments. Built from the ground up using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, I generated and analyzed realistic financial data involving:

- **200 Nigerian-based customers**
- **Bank accounts per customer**
- **Over 1,000+ transaction records** across various banking services.

---

## Objective

To segment bank customers and accounts based on:
- **Behavior** (activity & transaction patterns)
- **Value** (high spenders & credit flow)
- **Geography** (city/region engagement)
- **Engagement** (single vs. multi-account holders, dormant users)

---

## Approach & Techniques

- Simulated realistic data using SQL functions for names, dates, transactions, etc.
- Created relationships across 3 core tables: `customers`, `accounts`, and `transactions`.
- Wrote **12 in-depth SQL queries** focused on real business insights:
  1. Total Spend per Customer  
  2. Salary Trend Analysis  
  3. Most Active Accounts by Number of Transactions  
  4. Most Active Accounts by Volume  
  5. Monthly Transaction Breakdown  
  6. Yearly Transaction Breakdown  
  7. Top 20 High-Value Customers (By Total Credit Amount)  
  8. Dormant Accounts (Inactive in 12+ Months)  
  9. Single Product Customers (1 Account Only)  
  10. Most Used Transaction Services  
  11. City-Wise Performance  
  12. Engagement by Region (Geo Spread)

> **Bonus Insight**: Highest Spender by City (added as extra business intelligence)

## Key Learnings

- Deepened practical SQL skills: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `FILTER`, `CTE`, `DATE_TRUNC`, etc.
- Improved ability to simulate and model banking datasets.
- Gained confidence in applying SQL to solve real-world financial analysis problems.
- Practiced data storytelling with metrics that could support business decisions (e.g., retention, VIP targeting, geo performance tracking).

---

## Business Relevance

This project mirrors the kind of analysis expected in a financial analyst or banking data role. For instance:
- **Salary trend tracking** supports income stability analysis.
- **Identifying dormant customers** helps drive re-engagement campaigns.
- **Top spenders and credit inflows** can influence personalized banking offers.

## Outcome

This SQL-only project now serves as a **key portfolio piece** highlighting my niche in financial data analysis and my ability to extract actionable insights using nothing but raw SQL.
